# Write a function that takes in an amount of money and denominations
#   and returns the number of ways to arrive at the amount with those denominations.

# Input amount and denominations
# If the number of denomination types == 1, then return 1 way to arrive at amount
# Asign denominations to value i.e. dime = 10
# Need to count the lowest denomination up to the second lowest denomination
#  then add the second lowest denomination until amount is reached
# Count this as 1 way
# Continue to do this adding more of the lowest denomination and less of the second
#  lowest denomination
